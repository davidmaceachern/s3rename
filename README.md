# s3rename

s3rename is a tool to mass-rename keys within an S3 bucket.

The interface is designed to mimic the Perl [rename](https://www.unix.com/man-page/linux/1/prename/) utility on
GNU/Linux (also known as `prename` and `perl-rename`).

s3rename uses asynchronous requests to rename the keys in parallel, as
fast as possible.

## Usage

```
USAGE:
    s3rename [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <expr> <s3-url>

FLAGS:
    -n, --dry-run    Do not carry out modifications (only print)
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -q, --quiet      Do not print key modifications
    -V, --version    Prints version information
    -v, --verbose    Print debug messages

OPTIONS:
        --aws-region <aws-region>    AWS Region (will be taken from bucket region if not overridden here)

ARGS:
    <expr>      Perl RegEx Replace Expression (only s/target/replacement/flags form supported)
    <s3-url>    S3 URL: s3://bucket-name/optional-key-prefix
```

### Examples

s3rename uses the Perl regular expression format (like sed) to rename
files:

```
$ aws s3 ls s3://s3rename-test-bucket --recursive
2020-05-01 12:30:25         16 testnewfile.txt

$ ./s3rename "s/new/old" s3://s3rename-test-bucket/test
Renaming testnewfile.txt to testoldfile.txt

$ aws s3 ls s3://s3rename-test-bucket --recursive
2020-05-01 12:33:48         16 testoldfile.txt
```

The `--dry-run` flag will print changes to be made without carrying them
out. This is __highly__ recommended before running changes.

### Renaming flat files to a nested directory structure for AWS Glue

This program was originally inspired by the need to rename the keys of 
thousands of files which were stored in a flat structure, so that they
could be correctly parsed by AWS Glue which requires a nested structure 
with the "directory" names corresponding to the partitions.

```
$ aws s3 ls s3://s3rename-test-bucket/datatest --recursive

```

Note the requirement to use named capture groups, this will be addressed
in a future version to allow numbered anonymous capture groups like sed.

## Known Issues

* Currently the rename operation is not atomic (since it involves
  separate CopyObject and DeleteObject requests) - this means that if
  s3rename is terminated during operation, the bucket could be left with
  copied files where the originals have not been renamed (re-running
  s3rename with the same arguments would fix this). This will be
  addressed in a future version.
* s3rename does not work with encrypted buckets (either by KMS or S3
  encryption) - this support will be added in a future version.
* Object ACLs (Access Control Lists) are currently overwritten, so all
  objects renamed will be set to Private. This will be addressed in a
  future version, but will likely require more requests and so be put
  behind a --keep-acl flag.
* The --no-overwrite flag is currently unimplemented, so there is no way
  to rename keys, but not carry out the rename if a key already exists
  with that name. This will be addressed in a future version.
* There is no way of filtering keys to be renamed based on their date
  modified, etc. - this will be addressed in a future version.

## S3 Billing

s3rename operates on keys within the same bucket and so should trigger
no [data transfer costs](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/).

Whilst it does use CopyObjectRequests to carry out the renaming, the
additional data does not exist for long and should trigger no costs for
data usage:

Regarding billing for data storage, the [S3 Billing documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/#Billing) states:

> The volume of storage billed in a month is based on the average storage used throughout the month.
> This includes all object data and metadata stored in buckets that you created under your AWS account.
> We measure your storage usage in “TimedStorage-ByteHrs,” which are added up at the end of the month to generate your monthly charges.
